* Trunk with seats folded down
   - Max depth with the passenger's seat moved all the way front: 213cm
   - The folded seats form a floor which is not flush with the trunk floor and ascends a bit;
     transporting items over 200cm long only gives you height of ~35cm

     seats is only 19cm and the height of transported items is ~35cm.
