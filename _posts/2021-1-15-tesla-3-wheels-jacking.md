title: Tesla Model 3 2020 - general maintenance
---

This article shows tips for maintenance of various car parts: replacing windshield
wipers, spare lug nuts, how to jack the car, etc.

## Do It Yourself

Make sure to read the [Tesla Model 3 Do It Yourself](https://www.tesla.com/support/do-it-yourself-model-3?redirect=no)
guide for lots of great tips.

## Spare wheel lug nuts

No idea where to buy spares, but they're not sold on [Finland Tesla Shop](https://shop.tesla.com/fi_fi/category/ajoneuvon-lisavarusteet/model-3).
However, what you can do is to buy the [Wheel Locks/Lukkomutterit](https://shop.tesla.com/fi_fi/product/lukkomutterit)
and replace 4 of the lug nuts with the lock ones. That will give you 4 spare lug nuts.

## Tightening the lug nuts

The tightening torque is 175 Nm; I recommend getting a proper torque spanner
such as [Momenttiavain 40-210 NM](https://www.biltema.fi/tyokalut/kasityokalut/hylsytyokalut/momenttiavaimet/momenttiavain-12-2000020911).
The socket size is 21".

## Jacking

You can buy Model 3 jackpad literally in any Tesla-related shop, just google for
Tesla Model 3 Jack Pad. For example get one at [Jack Pad nostotyyny Tesla Model 3 @ vempele.com](https://www.vempele.fi/tuote/jack-pad-nostotyyny-tesla-3/).
Remember to get a low profile jack: Model 3 has only 140 cm of ground clearance,
further reduced by the size of the jack pad itself.
This [Aluminium/Steel Jack, 2.5 tonnes from Biltema](https://www.biltema.fi/en-fi/car---mc/workshop-equipment/lifting-equipment/car-jacks/aluminiumsteel-jack-25-tonnes-2000038408)
works well for me.

## Tyres

I took 18" since they are most practical: lowest road noise and lowest chance of flat tyre.
Their spec is `235/45 ZR 18`. Alternatively you can get 19" and 20" as well.

## Windshield wiper replacement

One way is to get the [official Tesla Model 3 wipers at the Tesla Shop](https://shop.tesla.com/fi_fi/product/model-3_n-tuulilasinpyyhkimen-sulat).

Alternatively, the [Bosch Aerotwin A102S](https://www.autodoc.fi/bosch/7882805) work really well,
according to both my experience and the [TeslaBjorn's video](https://youtu.be/gHe5wvxjFcI?t=601):
* They're a pair of 650mm (26") and 475mm (19") wipers.
* You can also get them from vempele.fi: [RIDEX](https://www.vempele.fi/en/item/windscreen-wipers-ridex-tesla-model-3-y),
  [RIDEX plus](https://www.vempele.fi/en/item/windscreen-wipers-ridex-plus-tesla-model-3-y),
  [Bosch Aerotwin A102S](https://www.vempele.fi/en/item/windscreen-wipers-bosch-aerotwin-tesla-model-3-y)
  or [Valeo Silencio](https://www.vempele.fi/en/item/windscreen-wipers-valeo-silencio-vf818-tesla-model-3-y).

## TeslaCam - storing videos

Tesla now offers the [official USB key](https://shop.tesla.com/fi_fi/product/usb-drive---128-gb)
for storing TeslaCam videos. Alternatively you can get a 256GB SSD USB drive which works just as well,
but is a bit more expensive.

## Paint repair kit

Only sold in the US. There's [Paint repair kit at the US Tesla Shop](https://shop.tesla.com/product/paint-repair-kit),
but there's no such thing in [Finland Tesla Shop](https://shop.tesla.com/fi_fi/category/ajoneuvon-lisavarusteet/model-3).
The reason is that the paint repair kit is missing a CE-approval and thus not allowed in EU.

Basic repairs can be done with the Touch Up Paint Pen - make sure to get the right color:

* [vempele.fi](https://www.vempele.fi/en/item/paint-repair-tesla)
* [FIRANTO](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/FIRANTO-Paint-Repair-Tesla-Motors/dp/B09427NJSH)

## Cabin filters

It's recommended to change the cabin filters every 2 years.
You can get [Tesla 3 Cabin Filters from the Finland Tesla Shop](https://shop.tesla.com/fi_fi/product/model-3_n-ilmansuodatin).
They're not that expensive; just remember you need two of those.

See [Tesla 3 DIY](https://www.tesla.com/support/do-it-yourself-model-3?redirect=no)
under "Raitisilmasuodattimien vaihtaminen" on how to change those.

## Wall charger

The [Tesla wall charger](https://shop.tesla.com/fi_fi/product/hopeanvarinen-seinaliitin)
is the cheapest and best on the market. However, don't forget that:

1. A certified electrician needs to install it; the price of such installation can
   go up to 500 EUR (tax-deductible).
2. The Tesla wall charger doesn't have its own RCD fuse and you need to pay 200-300 EUR
   for a standalone RCD/RCCB fuse. See [Home Charging in Finland: Basics](../home-charging-finland-basics/)
   for more details.

## Tow Hitch

No idea. I can't see it being sold in [Finland Tesla Shop](https://shop.tesla.com/fi_fi/category/ajoneuvon-lisavarusteet/model-3),
but there are third-party vendors which do. However, one UK forum suggested
that Tesla sells tow hitch in Europe and using third-party could void your warranty,
so it's definitely better to verify this with the Tesla shop.

## 12V battery

See [Youtube video on how to swap Model 3 12v battery correctly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76PtZPF-Dvo).

According to [Tesla US Battery Specs](https://teslatap.com/articles/12-volt-battery-compendium/) Model 3 uses 45Ah AGM battery;
positive terminal on the right side. My 2020 Model 3 uses 45Ah 20HR 12V Battery with positive to the right; measured size is
W230mm x D120mm x H cca 200mm (220mm including the terminals). Coincidentally that's the same battery which my Nissan Leaf uses.

Possible replacement battery (unverified):
