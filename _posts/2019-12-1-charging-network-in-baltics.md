title: Charging Network In Baltics
---

The road through Estonia/Latvia/Lithuania/Poland is very good in terms of road quality,
but there are no chargers with "great" reliability - usually it's just one stand
with one AC plug and one DC plug. If it's broken or occupied, be prepared for a fallback
plan to find alternative charger. 

# General Tips

* Plan the trip first. You can use [A Better Route Planner](abetterrouteplanner.com/), however
  make sure you have at least 15%-20% battery left to reach next charger if the current one
  is broken or occupied.
* If the DC charger is broken, try to call the phone number on the charger. There is
  now EU-wide roaming so the calls are generally cheap; the call support should speak English
  and may be able to reboot the charger remotely, fixing the issue.
* If the DC charger is occupied and you can not wait, try to find nearest
  charging station via [PlugShare](https://www.plugshare.com/)
  and take a break there. However, if that one is broken, you may be
  forced to call a towing service, or find the next charger.
* It's best to prefer city-based chargers, since there are generally much more
  alternative chargers around.
  
From my experience all chargers worked (none were broken) and were mostly unoccupied;
only in 1/5 of times the chargers were occupied and I had to wait 15 minutes on average.

## Tesla Superchargers

There are no Tesla superchargers in the Baltic states as of now (2019), neither there are any chargers
above Warsaw in Poland. The superchargers are planned and should be erected in 2020,
you can see the [official Tesla Supercharger Map](https://www.tesla.com/supercharger) to get more information.

The [SuperCharge.info](https://supercharge.info/map) receives updates from Tesla
user community and thus keeps most up-to-date charger map.

# Estonia

[Volt](https://enefitvolt.com/en/elektriauto-laadimine) (used to be called Elmo previously)
operates a large network of chargers
in Estonia, basically covering entire country. The DC speed is 50kW and the prices are as follows:

* DC Type 1: 50kW CHAdeMO 0,24 €/kWh; after 60 min 0.1 €/min penalty is charged.
* AC: 22kW Type 2 0,22 €/kWh; after 180 min 0.05 €/min penalty is charged.

WARNING: Volt chargers do not provide Type 2 CCS connectors - they only offer
CHAdeMO and Type 1 CCS! Type 2 charging is AC-only 22kW, which is further limited
down by your car. For example for Tesla Model 3 you'll either need a CHAdeMO adapter (I'm not sure whether such
a thing even exists), or charge from Type 2 AC slowly at 11kW speed.

[Virta](https://virta.webapp.virtaglobal.com/) operates/roams a couple of chargers in Estonia,
and the one in Parnu is a 50kW free-to-use charger right next to a Hesburger -
worth a stop. Often occupied by the local taxi drivers though.

PlugSurfing shows no possible roaming. Shell Recharge only shows charger in Parnu and
Talinn and the price is horrible - 0,6€/kWh.

If you do not have the RFID, or you don't have CHAdeMO port, or you can't charge for other reason,
the best way is to charge up upfront, skip charging in Estonia and charge in Latvia;
nearest charger in Latvia is just 200km from Tallinn
(the Ainazi charger on Latvia borders). However, try stopping in Parnu and charge for free
if the charger is available - if it is, you will be able to travel through Latvia
and charge in Lithuania for free.

[IONITY](https://ionity.eu) is building two chargers in Estonia.
The price is an outrageous 0,79€/kWh, but could be life-saving if need be.
Alternatively, you can try [ZSE Drive](https://zsedrive.sk) which roams on Ionity chargers,
with a 24 hours flat rate of 39€/24h. That's really interesting option since charging 100kWh during the 24-hour window will
bring the price down to a reasonable 0,39€/kWh. See the "Slovakia" section
for tips on how to register.

# Latvia

[CSDD](https://www.csdd.lv/en/) is a national road maintenance authority that
also owns chargers. They provide CCS, CHAdeMO and Type 2 AC charging.
You can register at [e-mobi](https://portal.e-mobi.lv/lv/sakumlapa/) and download
the Android App in order to charge.
CSDD charging costs 0,15€/min with e-mobi, and 0,273€/min with PlugSurfing
(quite a decent price, however do remember that you'll generally charge at the speed of
35-40kW while still being billed by the minute).

I highly recommend getting a RFID token to activate the charger: in the worst
case you can get one from PlugSurfing. Charging via the e-mobi app is a lengthy
process (especially when combined with a verification procedure with Finnish S-Pankki)
and requires a solid internet connection, otherwise you will spend your time watching
a progress indicator rotating in the e-mobi app and cursing.

For example the internet connectivity
coverage of the [Vitrupe](https://www.plugshare.com/location/156536) charger
(the beach there is beautiful, definitely worth a stop) is so weak
you have to literally walk towards the main road to actually get a GSM signal.
Even if you manage to pay for your charging session, you will need to
touch the CCS adapter icon on the charger's touchscreen in order to actually charge.
The display times out quickly (10 seconds or even less),
and so you either rush towards the bloody charger, or you need someone else
to press the bloody touchscreen. If you don't, the session will time out, charging
won't start but 80€ will still be blocked on your credit card (even after 4 days
2x80€ hasn't been unblocked from my account). I spent 30 minutes
cursing and swearing like a sailor until I remembered I have a RFID token from PlugSurfing -
then the charging was a breeze.

[IONITY](https://ionity.eu) is building one charger; see above for tips on how to charge.

[PlugSurfing](https://www.plugsurfing.com/map) also roams with CSDD chargers but
it's more expensive than e-mobi prices, at 0,273€/min. Yet PlugSurfing's RFID was a lifesaver
when the e-mobi app just wouldn't work with flaky internet connection.

[Virta](https://virta.webapp.virtaglobal.com/) roams CSDD charging stations as well,
but the price is even worse than when using PlugSurfing: 0,4€/min.

# Lithuania

There are state-owned and State Roads Directorate-operated (LAKD) chargers.
According to PlugShare, [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/lithuania/comments/bqwn5f/electric_vehicle_charging/)
and my experience they work very well and are free to use.
The station is non-networked: you do not need any RFID or any kind of registration,
you should be simply able to connect and charge. If the charging doesn't start automatically,
just touch the display, select the CCS connector and start charging.

Alternatively there are paid chargers run by Renerga; the one in Klaipeda I found
can be activated using the Virta app for 0,25€/min.

No known roaming with PlugSurfing nor Shell Recharge.

[IONITY](https://ionity.eu) operates three chargers in Lithuania; see above for tips on how to charge.

# Poland

The biggest charging operator in Poland is [GreenWay Polska](https://greenwaypolska.pl/en/).
The prices are a bit expensive (0,49€ per kWh on DC, with additional time-based penalty when charging more
than 45/60 minutes), but there is no other operator. It's highly recommended
to register with GreenWay, since it is the most common charging network in Poland
and Slovakia by far.
There are quite a lot of charging
places (even though they only host 1AC+1DC charger, so the reliability rating is "fair").

PlugSurfing has currently no roaming in Poland.

There are Tesla superchargers in Poland, but they're not close to the Lithuania
borders. The closest one is a two stall in Warsaw, but it's located in a -5th level
in an underground parking garage with tight space behind a boon, so I avoided this one.
Luckily there is a new one in Radom;
also there are additional superchargers planned in 2020, namely in Ostrow Mazowiecka.
The Radom supercharger is a huge lifesaver, and the highway from Augustow to Warsaw to
Krakow is brand new; I definitely recommend you to take this route.
Avoid the "Warsaw - Czestochowa - Katowice" route - the concrete blocks forming the
road are completely destroyed, I was surprised that my wheels did not fell off.
Yet, the highway is being upgraded as of 2021 - in 2022+ this route may be viable.

The [Orlen Charge](https://orlencharge.orlen.pl/#/portal/locations) is network
of CCS, Type 2 and CHAdeMO chargers placed on Orlen gas pumps which comes handy
especially in Krakow since there are installed on six pumps. You can use the
[Orlen Charge Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.orlen.charge),
or you can charge via the
[Orlen Charge](https://orlencharge.orlen.pl/#/portal/locations) web page.
The prices are a bit expensive: 0,45€ per kWh on DC, with additional time-based penalty when
charging more than 45 minutes.

Surprisingly [Fortum Charge&Drive](https://map.chargedrive.com/en/) has a charger
in Warsaw and Krakow, you might try those out.

There's also GoNet EV CPMS network in Krakow, but the charging app looks weird,
and so I would not trust my credit card data to such an app.

# Slovakia

You can charge via [GreenWay Slovakia](https://greenway.sk/): the price is
a bit expensive 0,41€/kWh for 50kW DC.

Cheaper option is to charge on ZSE chargers: [ZSE Drive](https://zsedrive.sk):
either 0,39€/kWh for 50kW DC, or 0,49€/kWh for 175kW DC. Virta is able to roam
on ZSE, but the price is always 0,5€/kWh so it's better to use the ZSE card.
Interestingly, ZSE shares passwords with Virta: if you're registered with
Virta and you register to ZSE, the e-mail with the password will never come,
but the password from Virta will work (!).

Another possibility would be to charge on Slovnaft chargers. The service is currently
free of charge - just plug and charge: you don't need to register anywhere, you don't need to
ask the staff for access.
