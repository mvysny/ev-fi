title: Gaming In Your Tesla
---

After the latest software update, the Sky Force game (a space shooter) was added. Since I love
those kind of games, I decided to give it a try.

Unfortunately my wireless bluetooth PS3 controllers wouldn't work with the car
(none of the wireless controllers do, apparently they can't pair with Tesla Model 3).
Shopping time! Holy moly, most of the controllers cost 60â‚¬ or more, and most of
them are wireless (langaton). What you need is a langallinen peliohjain (wired game controller).

I've found the following controllers:

* [Spartan Controller](https://www.prisma.fi/fi/prisma/peliohjain-ps3-pc-spartan-langallinen) -
  untested.
* [Hama uRage Vendetta 100](https://www.prisma.fi/fi/prisma/hama-urage-vendetta-100-usb-pc-peliohjain) -
  works, but you must switch it to the "Direct Input" mode after you plug it in, by pressing the "Home" button
  for 5+ seconds until the third status LED from the left turns on. Beware: this controller
  doesn't work with the Cuphead game! It works with the Beach Buggy game and the Sky Force game though.
* [8BitDo USB langaton adapteri](https://www.prisma.fi/fi/prisma/8bitdo-usb-langaton-adapteri) -
  untested by me but it should work with my existing PS3 controllers,
  according to [8BitDo wireless controllers are perfect for Tesla's multiplayer games](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModel3/comments/dxtea4/8bitdo_wireless_controllers_are_perfect_for/).
