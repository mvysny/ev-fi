title: Nissan Leaf 2015 S - general maintenance
---

This article shows tips for maintenance of various car parts: replacing windshield
wipers, spare lug nuts, how to jack the car, etc.

## Spare wheel lug nuts

Long story short - after much searching I've finally found out that
Nissan Leaf 2015 uses M12 1,25 lug nuts; you can buy spare for example from
Biltema: [Wheel Nut Kit M12 x 1,25, 35mm, Art. 33-3305](https://www.biltema.fi/en-fi/car---mc/styling/exterior-styling/wheel-nuts-10-pcs-2000019355).

Note that the replacement lug nuts only work with the steel rims originally bundled
with the car; if you bought aluminium or other custom rims you need to shop
there for spare lug nuts.

## Tightening the lug nuts

The tightening torque is 112 NM; I recommend getting a proper torque spanner
such as [Momenttiavain 70-350 NM](https://www.biltema.fi/tyokalut/kasityokalut/hylsytyokalut/momenttiavaimet/momenttiavain-70-350-nm-2000030634).
The socket size is 21".

## Jacking

Nissan Leaf's underbody is not flat but instead there is a pinch rail or
a pinch weld; this [nissan leaf jack video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abbDGR60NsE)
contains more information.

What's totally weird is that I've failed to buy pinch rail jack adapter in Finland.
The Nissan dealership, Motonet and also Fixus simply told me that it's not being
sold in Finland, and that I should simply jack the car and risk twisting of the pinch rail.
Probably everyone simply uses a hockey puck or similar. The best thing
might be to order a pinch rail jack adapter from AliExpress or Amazon and have
it delivered to Finland, but that could be rather expensive.

I tried to order something from AliExpress, but the rubber is not strong enough:
it twists and bends almost to the point of the car falling off the jack stand.

I ultimately purchased [Biltema's Jack Pad](https://www.biltema.fi/autoilu---mp/korjaamovarusteet/nostotyokalut/tunkit/jack-pad-2000017051)
and a couple of hockey pucks - looks to be working the best.

## Windshield wiper replacement

* Rear windshield wiper: 250mm; I bought [Bosch Rear H250 wiper in Motonet](https://www.motonet.fi/fi/tuote/129580/Bosch-H250-takalasinpyyhin-25-cm);
  for replacement tutorial see the [Nissan Windshield replacement video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDfQ0MzSZtE)
* Front windshield wipers:
   * Driver's side: 650mm/26" Hybrid; I bought [Bosch AeroTwin Retrofit AR26U/AR650U in Motonet](https://www.motonet.fi/fi/tuote/120192/Bosch-AeroTwin-RetroFit-AR26U--AR650U-tuulilasinpyyhin-65-cm)
   * Passenger: 400mm/16" Hybrid; I bought [Bosch AeroTwin RetroFit AR 16 U / AR 400 U in Motonet](https://www.motonet.fi/fi/tuote/120184/Bosch-AeroTwin-RetroFit-AR16U--AR400U-tuulilasinpyyhin-40-cm).
     The page also links to a video showing how to replace the wiper.
   * You can also buy both wipers as a pair: [Bosch AeroTwin Retro AR653S at Autodoc](https://www.autodoc.fi/bosch/1194314).

Where to buy them:

* [Biltema: Nissan Leaf Wiper Blades](https://www.biltema.fi/en-fi/search-page/?query=wiper%20blade%20nissan%20leaf)
  but they're frequently out-of-stock
* Motonet stacks the good quality Bosch wipers - I recommend shopping for windshield wipers there.

I've discovered the wiper exact part types via [Bosch Wiper Blade finder](https://www.boschwiperblades.com/)
which will find AR26U and AR16U exactly as above. You need to put Nissan Leaf 2018 there since
the page doesn't seem to recognize Leaf 2015 anymore.
* The AR stands for "AEROTWIN Upgrade" whatever that is,
* The U stands probably for Hybrid, or god knows what.

## 12V battery

Check out this [youtube video on replacing the 12v battery in nissan leaf 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS3ssRpJYdg).

US-made Nissan Leaf 2015 battery group is 51R; the dimensions should be 238 x 129 x 223 mm; the terminal connector diameter is 17mm. Make sure to pay attention to R which says that
the positive terminal is to the **right**. (measured on my leaf: W=230mm, D=130mm, H=200mm, height including the terminal connectors = 220mm).

The battery CCA is 410 which gives the Ah rating of ~38 according to [BatteryEquivalents Group 51 and 51R](https://www.batteryequivalents.com/group-51-and-51r-batteries-dimensions-features-and-recommendations.html) and 360 EN according to [CCA->EN Table](https://battery-service.com/support/cca/).

In Finland here are proper replacements for the battery:
* [BATTERY SMF 12V 45AH](https://www.biltema.fi/en-fi/car---mc/car-spares/electrical-system/car-batteries/battery-smf-12v-45ah-2000029829)
* [Sznajder-Silver 45Ah/360A akku P237xL127xK225 -+](https://m.motonet.fi/fi/tuote/903009/Sznajder-Silver-45Ah360A-akku-P237xL127xK225--)

* [Exide EB454 45Ah/330A akku P237xL127xK227](https://m.motonet.fi/fi/tuote/909512/Exide-EB454-45Ah330A-akku-P237xL127xK227)
